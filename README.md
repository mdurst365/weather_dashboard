# About this project

This is a homework assignment for the OSU coding bootcamp. In this assignment the developers are tasked with using an application's API and using it in the context of their own. In this case I am using data from a third-party weather API (OpenWeather API). The challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. It also makes use of local storage to store any persistent data.

## Task List

- [X] Create weather dashboard with form inputs
- [X] Allow the user to search for a city and then return the current and future weather conditions for that city 
- [X] Save the and city into the user's search history using local storage
- [X] When the user views current weather conditions for that city present the user with city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
- [X] When the user views the UV index demonstrate color coding that indicates if the weather conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
- [X] When the user views future weather conditions for that city present a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
- [X] When the user clicks on a city in the search history then the user will again be presented with current and future conditions for that city
- [X] When the user opens the weather dashboard then the user is presented with the last searched city forecast
